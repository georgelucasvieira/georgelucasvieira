Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer with 3yrs of experience primarily focused on back-end who, you know, sometimes does front-end ðŸ™‚.  
  
Currently working at @Fitbank as Staff Software Developer focused on the back-end Software Architecture.

My interests and next goals are:
 - RAG, LLM, Vectorial and Hybrid Search world and what type of application I can do with **ElasticSearch** and **Apache Lucene**.
 - Establish myself as someone active on github and others platforms and reciprocate all the help I've already received by the community
 - Make my first open source contribution

Technologies that I work on my daily basis:

When it comes to **front-end**, my preferred architectural style is when you only use JavaScript when necessary.  
So, besides the famous and mainstream NextJS and Angular, I really like:
- HTMX
- AlpineJS
- Svelte
